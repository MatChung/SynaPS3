Welcome to SynaPS3. 
To start using SynaPS3 immediately, add "system.h", and other desired includes.

SynaPS3 is still in it's early stages, and lacks a lot of stuff it should have. Please excuse the mess.
If you think you have a contribution that we could add, or have found a bug, let me know by emailing geokoder@gmail.com.

Thanks to moh.sakhaii, Mathieulh, geohot, KaKaRoTo, fail0verflow, flukes1, and the devs at #ps3dev.

Best regards,
