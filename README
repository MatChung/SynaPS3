Welcome to SynaPS3. 
To start using SynaPS3 immediately, add "system.h", and other desired includes. Adding "syscalls.h" is not necessary.

Remember that SynaPS3 is still in the early stages, additions should follow soon that will make SynaPS3 a major help to the scene.
If you think you have a contribution that we could add, or have found a bug, let us know by emailing geokoder@gmail.com.

NOTE: Hermes v3/v4 are currently limited to ONE mount using syscall8. This includes the following functions: 
- Mount
- MountHome
Using any of the above functions will use up the available mount. The next use will overwrite the existing mount.

Payloads without syscall35 or syscall8 have no Mount support. 

For best results please use PL3Dev.

Best regards,
