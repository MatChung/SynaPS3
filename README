Welcome to SynaPS3. 
To start using SynaPS3 immediately, just include "synaps3.h".

Please only use functions described in documentation.html. All others are buggy, for specific testing, or don't work at all.
Functions that are getting ready to be included in SynaPS3, but are not fully developed and tested, will be in SynaPS3dev, found in "synaps3_dev.h". Use with caution.

Remember that SynaPS3 is still in the early stages, additions should follow soon that will make SynaPS3 a major help to the scene.
If you think you have a contribution that we could add, let us know by emailing geokoder@gmail.com.
