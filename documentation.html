<p>This library has been made by someone not seeking fame, profit or benefit.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t want to cause any damage to the video game industry, but it is not reasonable that these consoles (that are expensive) are constructed like a faraday cage and we can not do anything to unlock the full potential of our investment, while Sony is burning holes through our pockets when you send a console for repair and they are dedicated to eliminating original features of the console, such as PS3 Other OS and Linux, relying on what they think best for your business and not caring for the feelings of their users or their acquired rights as users and owners of their consoles.</p>

<p>The videogame industry only wants control, oligopoly, money, pursuit of anything that does not benefit their interests and if it is possible, force legal changes using their influence and power while we&#8217;re just anonymous people having to endure all the crap on hardware that is passed through a computer</p>

<p>It is &#8216;illegal&#8217; to build things with the <i>SONY SDK</i> unlicensed, but this is only source code.</p>

<p>Functions are described and documented in each of the library source files.</p>

<p><b>You can modify the library any way you want, but please, make public the source code.</b></p>
